# Endpoints:

## GET`/products`
- The endpoint queries the database;
- Returns status 200 and all bank products;

## POST `/products`
- The endpoint registers a new product;
- The endpoint must receive the following structure:

```json
  {
    "name": "Longsword",
    "amount": "30 gold pieces"
  }
```
- If any data is not informed, the API returns status 400 and an error message;
- If the registration is successful, the API returns status 201 and product data;

## POST `/users`;
- The endpoint registers a new user;
- The endpoint must receive the following structure:
```json
{
  "username": "string",
  "class": "string",
  "level": 1,
  "password": "string"
}
```
- If any data is not informed, the API returns status 400 and an error message;
- If the registration is successful, the API returns status 201 and an access token;

## GET `/orders`.
- The endpoint queries the database;
- The route returns status 200 and the orders and product `id`s associated with them.

## POST `/login`
- The route receives the `username` and `password` fields, and these fields are validated in the database;
- A `JWT` token is generated and returned if successful;

    "username": "string",
    "password": "string"
  }
```

- The request will only be created if the user is logged in (send the token through the request header using the Authorization key);
- The orders sent are saved in the `Orders` table and the `Products` table is updated in all products with the `id` included in the `productsIds` key of the requisition, and adding in these products the `orderId` of the newly created order;
- The endpoint must receive the following structure:
